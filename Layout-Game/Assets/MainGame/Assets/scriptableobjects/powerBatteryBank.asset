  irlex: "The \u201Cbattery bank\u201D on the ISS is a set of batteries used to store
    solar power generated when the station is in sunlight, for use during eclipse
    periods when the station is in Earth\u2019s shadow. The older batteries were
    nickel-hydrogen (Ni-H\u2082) type; NASA has been replacing them with lithium-ion
    batteries which offer higher energy density, lighter weight, and longer lifespan.
    \r\nThere are 8 power channels on the station; each channel has multiple battery
    units (total ~48 batteries in older configurations). The charging happens when
    in sunlight (~45 min per orbit), then during eclipse the batteries supply power."
