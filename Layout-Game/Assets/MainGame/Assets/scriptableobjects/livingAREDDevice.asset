  irlex: "The Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) is an advanced resistance
    machine designed for use in microgravity onboard the ISS. It uses vacuum pistons
    and mechanical systems (flywheel and cable) to simulate weight-bearing exercises
    (squats, deadlifts, calf raises, etc.). \r\nIts advantage lies in providing a
    more constant resistance throughout the motion path (not relying on gravity),
    and its resistance levels are adjustable for different astronauts, with data
    logging of performance. \r"
