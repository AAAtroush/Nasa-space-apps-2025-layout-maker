  irlex: "The 3D printer aboard ISS is part of NASA\u2019s 3D Printing in Zero G
    experiment and the station\u2019s Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF). The
    first plastic 3D printer was sent in 2014 to build tools like wrenches and brackets.
    \r\nMore recently, ESA sent a metal 3D printer to ISS. This metal printer deposits
    stainless steel wire melted by a laser, in a controlled, sealed chamber (often
    with nitrogen environment to prevent oxidation). \r\nThe purpose is to allow
    on-demand manufacture of spare parts and tools, reducing reliance on Earth resupply,
    and supporting sustainability in deep-space missions.\r\n"
