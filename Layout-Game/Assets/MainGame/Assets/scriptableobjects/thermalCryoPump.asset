  irlex: "The Ammonia Pump Module is a core component in the ISS\u2019s External
    Active Thermal Control System (EATCS). Its function is to pump liquid ammonia
    through the external cooling loops, transferring heat from the internal systems
    into heat exchangers and then to radiator panels, which reject the heat into
    space. \r\nThe module houses a canned motor cartridge pump, which avoids rotary
    seals (thus reducing leak risk), along with an accumulator and control valves
    in the Pump and Control Valve Package (PCVP). In case of failure, the unit is
    designed to be replaced via an Extravehicular Activity (EVA). "
