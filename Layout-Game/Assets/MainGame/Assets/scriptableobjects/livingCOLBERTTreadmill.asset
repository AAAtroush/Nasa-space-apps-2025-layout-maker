  irlex: "The COLBERT treadmill (also called T2) is a treadmill for running/walking
    in space, specially engineered to minimize vibration transfer to experiments
    and the station structure. It includes a vibration isolation system, sometimes
    passive, minimizing power consumption. \r\nCrew members wear harnesses or bungee
    cords to stay in contact with the treadmill, since there is no gravity to hold
    them down. \r\nThe treadmill is engineered to spread loads safely through the
    ISS structural elements even during extended running sessions."
