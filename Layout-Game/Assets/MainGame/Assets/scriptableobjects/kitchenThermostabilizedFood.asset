  irlex: "Thermostabilized food refers to foods treated at a specific temperature
    and duration to eliminate harmful microbes while preserving as much nutrition
    and flavor as possible. They are then sealed in barrier pouches. This technique
    is applied for foods that can\u2019t be fully freeze-dried (e.g. sauces, certain
    meats). On ISS, such foods are stored (often at ambient temperature) and heated
    or prepared for consumption when needed."
