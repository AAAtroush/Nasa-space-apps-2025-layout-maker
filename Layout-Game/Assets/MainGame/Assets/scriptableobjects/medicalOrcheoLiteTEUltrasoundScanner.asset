  irlex: "The ultrasound system on ISS is the primary medical imaging method available
    aboard. It\u2019s used for cardiac, vascular, abdominal, musculoskeletal, thoracic
    examinations, among others. \r\nThere is a fixed ultrasound suite in the Human
    Research Facility which includes high-definition capabilities, and has real-time
    video downlink to allow remote guidance by Earth-based medical experts. \r\nPortable
    ultrasound units (e.g. Butterfly IQ, Orcheo Lite TE) are also tested to enable
    more flexible use, with lighter weight and reduced power consumption, while still
    allowing remote support.\r"
