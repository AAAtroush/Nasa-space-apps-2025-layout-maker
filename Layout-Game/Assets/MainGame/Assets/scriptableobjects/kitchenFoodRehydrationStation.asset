  irlex: The Food Rehydration System is the mechanism by which water is injected
    into freeze-dried food packets to restore them to edible form. The packaging
    typically includes special valves that allow water injection while preventing
    leaks or air escape and is designed to distribute fluid evenly. After the water
    is added, the food sits to absorb it and may be heated or stirred to enhance
    rehydration.
