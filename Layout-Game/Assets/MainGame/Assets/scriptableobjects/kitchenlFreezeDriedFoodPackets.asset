  gameex: Basic rations. Provides balanced nutrition, generates waste. Essential
    for survival.
  irlex: "Freeze-dried food is food from which almost all moisture has been removed
    under vacuum at low temperature, causing ice to sublimate directly into vapor.
    The aim is to reduce mass and volume while preserving nutrition and flavor as
    much as possible. To consume, astronauts add water (hot or cold, depending on
    the food) to rehydrate it.\r\nThis method is used on ISS because the food can
    remain shelf-stable without refrigeration and is packaged in hermetic, moisture-
    and oxygen-barrier pouches.\r"
