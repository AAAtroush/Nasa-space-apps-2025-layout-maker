  irlex: The ISS Water Recovery System (WRS) comprises the Urine Processor Assembly
    (UPA), Water Processor Assembly (WPA), and the Brine Processor Assembly (BPA).
    These units recover water from urine, humidity condensate, and hygiene water.
    After upgrades (including BPA), total water recovery efficiency reached about
    98%, greatly reducing resupply needs. Processes include vacuum distillation,
    adsorption, ion-exchange, catalytic reactors, and multi-stage filtration. Reclaimed
    water is used for drinking, hygiene, and as feedstock for electrolysis (OGA).
