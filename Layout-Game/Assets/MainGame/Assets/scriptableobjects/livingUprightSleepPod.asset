    sleep stations via mounting straps or fixtures, preventing the bag from drifting
    in microgravity. The bag offers a private sleeping environment, includes an interior
    liner, and may incorporate mild ventilation around the head area to circulate
    air. Its purpose is to provide a stable sleeping condition, prevent floating
    during sleep, and ensure a dedicated space with lighting and thermal control
    for rest.\r"
